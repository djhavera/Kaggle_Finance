    "**Income Statement:** The income statement is a summary of a business's performance over a period of time. An income statement contains revenue and expenses. It ultimately answers the question did the company make money over the specified time period. You can think of an income statement like your checking account. For example, over the last 3 months was your income higher than your expenses?\n",

    "**Balance Sheet:** A balance sheet is a snapshot in time of a company's health at a given point in time that separates out assets from liabilities. An asset is anything of value such as a piece of property or a piece of machinery. In personal finance, an asset would be anything that you own outright such as a car or any investments that you may have such as 401k retirement savings. A liability is a debt that is owed by the company to another party. In personal finance, a liability would be short term credit card debt or a mortgage. The balance sheet also illustrates how a company finances its operations with debt or equity. We will discuss capital structure in another session.\n",

    "### Company Valuation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now that we have a basic understanding of how a company organizes its finances, let's jump into how companies are valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary ways to evaluate a company:  discounted cash flow models (DCF) and models of relative valuation (1).  DCF models determine the value of a company based on its fundamentals such as information from the financial statements.  Relative valuation models use ratios such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio to determine valuation.  We will be focusing on a specific DCF model called the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) in this tutorial because of its simplicity and ease of use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DDM is a great place to start when calculating company value because it illustrates the basic principles of company valuation.  This model assumes that \"A share of a company is worth the present value of all the cash flows an investor expects to pocket from it.\" (1)  In a very simplistic world, this is like how a bond is valued.  An investor buys a bond for an expected yield (i.e. 3%) and the bond price is determined according to this yield.  In terms of stocks, a dividend is like a bond yield because it is the cash that an investor receives from the investment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss two examples of the DDM calculation in this tutorial.  First, we will review the simplest form of DDM which defines a company's value based on its dividend (D) divided by a required return on equity (R). Next, we will modify that formula to include the growth of the dividend in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1 DDM Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "  +  Investor holds stock forever\n",
    "  +  Dividend does not grow\n",
    "  +  Calculation: Value = D / R \n",
    "    +    D = Dividend\n",
    "    +    R = Return on Equity\n",
    "       \n",
    "Example 2 DDM Assumptions\n",
    "  +  Investor holds stock forever\n",
    "  +  Dividend grows in line with company history\n",
    "  + Calculation: Value = (D*1+g) / (R - g)\n",
    "    + D = Dividend\n",
    "    + R = Return on Equity\n",
    "    + g = Dividend Growth Rate\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will assume the investor holds the stock forever.  However, in the real world this is probably not very accurate because investors change investments all the time.  Additionally, the underlying principle, (i.e. bond and stock investment) can change and the investor isn't guaranteed to receive their original investment back and companies can cut the dividend so it is not guaranteed.  Either way, the fundamentals of the dividend discount model hold true throughout all valuation models.  More specifically, a company's value is based off future cash flows given to investors.  As we will see with the next financial 101 tutorials, the art of company valuation is replacing the dividend with a better estimate of cash flows.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDM example 2 is much closer to the actual stock price and calculates that CAT is overvalued.  In fact, the DDM model will generally underestimate the value of a company because it assumes that all relevant information is taken into account by the dividend.  This is a virtually impossible assumption to achieve because a dividend is not based on perfect information. In fact, companies are incentivized to keep the dividend and a downward dividend adjustment will have very negative consequences on the stock price (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a blind spot for the DDM because it is not able to evaluate companies that do not pay a dividend.  For example, the DDM would not be able to calculate a value for Alphabet Inc and Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we will move to a more advanced company valuation model called the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) in the next tutorial.  This model is like the DDM model in that it uses cash flows to determine company value.  However, the WACC model does not use the dividend as a proxy for cash flows.  The WACC model is the most used discounted cash flow model and we will get to explore the balance sheet and statement of cash flows during the tutorial.\n"
